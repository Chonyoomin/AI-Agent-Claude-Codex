# Agentic AI Coding Loop

Agentic AI Coding Loop is a local orchestration project for running a controlled, phase-gated build-review-fix workflow between Codex and Claude Code.

Codex acts as the planner, task-state manager, reviewer, validator, and fix-prompt generator. Claude Code acts as the implementation agent for the active phase only. A local orchestrator manages prompts, artifacts, validation logs, and loop state. A human approves movement between phases and separately approves any eventual commit.

## Goal

Reduce manual copy/paste between Codex and Claude Code while keeping the workflow auditable, scoped, and safe.

## MVP

The first version focuses on a small local loop:

- read a human-provided objective
- let Codex maintain `TASK.md` and active phase state
- generate a focused Claude implementation prompt
- let Claude implement the requested phase
- capture Claude's structured summary
- capture `git diff` and `git status`
- run validation commands and save logs
- let Codex review the prompt, summary, diff, and logs
- generate a fix prompt if needed
- stop after each approved phase until the human starts the next one

## Workflow

This section describes the intended end-to-end workflow once the orchestrator (Phase 3) is built. Until then, the same loop runs by hand - see `## Running The Loop Manually (Phase 1)` below.

1. Human provides the project objective or updates the desired outcome.
2. Codex updates `TASK.md`, `.agent-loop/current-task.md`, and `.agent-loop/current-phase.md` for the active phase.
3. Codex writes `.agent-loop/claude-prompt.md`.
4. Claude Code implements only the active phase and writes `.agent-loop/claude-summary.md`.
5. The orchestrator captures diff, status, and validation logs.
6. Codex writes `.agent-loop/codex-review.md` with one verdict:
   - `APPROVED_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW`
   - `NEEDS_FIXES`
   - `FAILED_REQUIRES_HUMAN`
7. If fixes are required, Codex writes `.agent-loop/fix-prompt.md`.
8. Claude applies targeted fixes within the same phase.
9. The loop repeats until the phase is approved, escalated, or reaches max cycles.
10. When a phase is approved, the system stops until the human starts the next phase.
11. The system never commits without separate human approval.

## Repository Files

Top-level project files:

- `README.md`: public project overview
- `AGENTS.md`: operating rules, review standards, and artifact formats
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code implementation contract
- `ROADMAP.md`: phased delivery plan
- `TASK.md`: Codex-maintained task and phase record derived from the human objective

Loop artifacts:

## Safety

- no auto-commit
- no auto-push
- no hidden validation failures
- no trusting summary text over actual diffs and logs
- no phase advancement without human approval
- no final commit without human approval

## Running The Loop Manually (Phase 1)

While the orchestrator is not yet built, the loop runs by hand against the artifact formats defined in `AGENTS.md`. One full manual cycle:

1. Codex updates `TASK.md`, `.agent-loop/current-task.md`, and `.agent-loop/current-phase.md` for the active phase.
2. Codex writes the implementation prompt to `.agent-loop/claude-prompt.md` using the required Claude task format.
3. A human pastes that prompt into Claude Code.
4. Claude Code implements only the active phase and writes `.agent-loop/claude-summary.md` using the required Claude implementation summary format.
5. A human captures evidence into `.agent-loop/`:
   - `git diff > .agent-loop/git-diff.patch`
   - `git status > .agent-loop/git-status.log`
   - test, lint, typecheck, and build output to `.agent-loop/test-output.log`, `.agent-loop/lint-output.log`, `.agent-loop/typecheck-output.log`, `.agent-loop/build-output.log` (or record "Not run" explicitly).
6. A human pastes the prompt, summary, diff, and logs into Codex.
7. Codex writes `.agent-loop/codex-review.md` with exactly one verdict: `APPROVED_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW`, `NEEDS_FIXES`, or `FAILED_REQUIRES_HUMAN`.
8. If the verdict is `NEEDS_FIXES`, Codex writes `.agent-loop/fix-prompt.md` and the cycle repeats from step 3 within `max_cycles`.
9. The cycle stops for human approval before any commit, and again before the next phase begins.

`.agent-loop/loop-state.json` records the active phase, task, cycle count, max cycles, and last verdict by hand.

## Current Status

The instruction contract, prompt formats, review formats, task and phase ownership rules, and safety model are in place. Phase 1 (Manual File-Based Loop), Phase 2A (Evidence Collection Contract), Phase 2B (`scripts/run_checks.sh`), and Phase 3 (Scripted Orchestrator MVP, delivered as sub-phases 3A through 3E) are all complete; the historical sub-phase record is preserved in `.agent-loop/phase-plan.md`. The project is currently in **Phase 4A - Planning Contract**: defining, before any code is written, the contract that a future automatic phase planner must satisfy when proposing the next phase or sub-phase. Phase 4A is documentation only; the planner implementation itself is deferred to a later 4x sub-phase activated only after 4A is approved.

The Phase 4A contract lives in `.agent-loop/phase-plan.md` under `## Phase 4A - Planning Contract` and specifies: which files the planner reads (read-only), which artifacts the planner is allowed to write (the proposal `.agent-loop/proposed-phase.md` and the optional `.agent-loop/planner.log` autonomously; the planning-state files only on explicit human approval), the required structure of a valid proposal (label, objective, definition of done, exclusions, files likely involved, required contract changes, cycle-size estimate, dependencies, risk areas), bounded-scope rules (file-count cap, single-contract-revision cap, testability requirement, etc.), the explicit human-approval signal required for activation (`APPROVED_FOR_ACTIVATION` token in a `## Approval` section the planner did not author), refusal / halt conditions (unresolved `NEEDS_FIXES`, `FAILED_REQUIRES_HUMAN`, any `halted_*` status, stale evidence, vague proposals, etc.), and the failure modes the planner must handle gracefully. No planner code is shipped in this sub-phase.

Deferred to later 4x sub-phases: planner implementation, planner-orchestrator integration, optional planner adapter. Deferred to later phases generally: approval modes (Phase 5), optional context and tool layer (Phase 6), editor integration (Phase 7), documentation and project polish (Phase 8). The Phase 3 orchestrator surface (`scripts/agent_loop.py`, `scripts/run_checks.sh`) is unchanged by Phase 4A.
